## Overview

Saw this idea on Reddit and thought it was pretty funny. Made a helloworld bruteforcer, but with full unicode support.

## Usage  

```
  -w string
        A string to bruteforce (default "hello world")
```

Best ran in a clear terminal, since it uses control characters to update the console in place:  

```
reset && go run main.go -w 'Hello world 👾🐈🏀🎸🍩🤯'
```
